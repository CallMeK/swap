##Swap
Submission for the 2013 Github Game Jam

By [@nmoroze](https://github.com/nmoroze) and [@themichaelyang](https://github.com/themichaelyang).


##About the Game
Swap is a game written in Javascript using the HTML 5 canvas for rendering. It is playable in the browser [here](nmoroze.github.io/swap), and is working in Chrome, Safari, Firefox, and Internet Explorer 11. 

Swap is a puzzle game where you progress through 20 diverse and challenging levels, changing the character you're controlling to reach your goal. However, characters move on their own when you swap out of them, so be careful! Frustrating but fun, Swap keeps track of your deaths as you move through the game, but if you're stuck you can always use the 'skip' button to move on, or use the 'reset' button to reset the level without incrementing the death counter. 

##Controls
WASD/arrow keys - move your character

Space - swap to another character
